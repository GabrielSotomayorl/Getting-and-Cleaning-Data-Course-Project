# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This Repo is part of the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course. 
It includes data about wearable computing, specifically data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

It includes the following files:

`CodeBook.md` Describe the variable and the transformations performed on the original data

`TidyData.txt`The final Tidy Data Base

`TidyDataPreparation.R` Includes all the steps from the raw data (link in the codebook) to the tidy data, as is asked on the instructions:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity   and each subject.
